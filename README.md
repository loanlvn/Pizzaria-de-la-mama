# 🍕 La Pizzaria de la Mama — HTML & CSS Practice

> A simple, static website built **for fun** to practice the **HTML & CSS** I had just learned.  
> This was my **first solo project**, created only a few weeks after starting web-dev classes — not professional, but a key step in applying the basics **by myself** for the first time.

---

## 🎯 Goal & Context
- Purpose: practice **semantic HTML** and **CSS** (layout, typography, spacing).
- Timeline: early learning phase (a few weeks into my course).
- Scope: **frontend only** (no JavaScript, no backend).
- Outcome: a playful restaurant landing page that helped me consolidate fundamentals.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** for structure and semantics  
- **CSS3** for layout and styling (responsive basics)

> No frameworks, no build tools — just vanilla HTML/CSS.

---

## 📐 What I Practiced
- Structuring pages with semantic tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
- Building clean, reusable CSS (typography scale, spacing, simple grid/flex layouts)
- Basic responsiveness (mobile-first mindset)
